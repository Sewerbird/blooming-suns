# Sovereign of the Blooming Suns
**Emperor of the Fading Suns Inspired Löve Game**

This is an attempt to work a 4X Strategy Game featuring detailed planet-side mechanics, a la Emperor of the Fading Suns. It's pretty embryonic right now.

## Developer Setup

- Download & Install [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) for your platform.
- Checkout this repository with Git.
- Run with `love .` in the repository root. You may have to set up an alias in your terminal.

## Contributions

- Feel free to suggest a feature in a ticket, or report a bug. NOTE: game is very early in development (isn't even a game as of writing this section...) so some patience plz.
- Feel free to find an existing issue and fix it. Make a pull request to submit: I'll include it if it doesn't break everything, is on the roadmap, and such.
- This is a personal casual side project
- Feel free to fork, although sewerbird/blooming-suns is the 'official' fork so far as I'm concerned

Pull requests on forks will be reviewed and merged upstream to Sewerbird/blooming-suns
